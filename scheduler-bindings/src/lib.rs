//! Messages passed between agave and an external pack process.
//! Messages are passed via `shaq::Consumer/Producer`.
//!
//! Memory freeing is responsibility of the external pack process,
//! and is done via `rts-alloc` crate. It is also possible the external
//! pack process allocates memory to pass to agave, BUT it will still be
//! the responsibility of the external pack process to free that memory.
//!
//! Setting up the shared memory allocator and queues is done outside of
//! agave - it can be done by the external pack process or another
//! process. agave will just `join` shared memory regions, but not
//! create them.
//! Similarly, agave will not delete files used for shared memory regions.
//! See `shaq` and `rts-alloc` crates for details.
//!
//! The basic architecture is as follows:
//!        ┌───────────────┐       ┌─────────────────┐
//!        │  tpu_to_pack  │       │ progress_tracker│
//!        └───────┬───────┘       └───────┬─────────┘

//! - [`TpuToPackMessage`] are sent from `tpu_to_pack` queue to the
//!   external scheduler process. This passes in tpu transactions to be scheduled,
//!   and optionally vote transactions.
//! - [`ProgressMessage`] are sent from `progress_tracker` queue to the
//!   external scheduler process. This passes information about leader status
//!   and slot progress to the external scheduler process.
//! - [`PackToWorkerMessage`] are sent from the external scheduler process
//!   to worker threads within agave. This passes a batch of transactions
//!   to be processed by the worker threads. This processing can also involve
//!   resolving the transactions' addresses, or similar operations beyond
//!   execution.
//! - [`WorkerToPackMessage`] are sent from worker threads within agave
//!   back to the external scheduler process. This passes back the results
//!   of processing the transactions.
